#### _API for the Botanical Adventure MVC._

## Technologies Used

* _C#_
* _.NET Core_
* _MySQL_
* _Entity_

## Description

_The Botanical Adventure API provides with a database of mushrooms, flowers and trees in the coast, desert and forest of Oregon._

_All requests are made to endpoints beginning: http://localhost:5004/api/_

_The API has one endpoint:_
* _api/items_

_api/items provides with a database of mushrooms, flowers and trees. Users can filter the search based on four parameters (name, category, type, difficulty) in the following way:_
* _api/items?name='The name of the botanical item the user wants to look for'_
* _api/items?category='The category of the botanical item the user wants to look for'_
* _api/items?type='The type of the botanical item the user wants to look for'_
* _api/items?difficulty='The difficulty of the botanical item the user wants to look for'_

###### * _This API will host the database for the [Botanical Adventure MVC website](https://github.com/curiousmockingbird/team-week-mvc.git)._

## Setup

* _If you haven't yet, install the dotnet ef tool through your command line (run $ dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef --version 5.0.1)_
* _On the root directory, create an appsettings.json fie and add the following code:_  
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft": "Warning",
      "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information"

  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=forage_mvc;uid=root;pwd=[Your-MySql-password-here];"
  }
}
